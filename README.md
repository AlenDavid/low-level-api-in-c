# low-level TCP/HTTP in C language

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is just a playground repository implementing a HTTP server in C.

Contributions are welcome!

## How to run this

Well, everyone has `make` command in your OS. You can build the server executable by just running

```bash
make
```

in the project directory. After building the executable, you can run it by calling `./main` in your terminal.

## Project directions

I'm expecting to build this just for fun. C programming is something that I have a personal interest.

## Contribution directions

Feel free to raise any issues and PRs are always welcome!
